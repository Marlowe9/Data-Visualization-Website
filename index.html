        The topic that I want to talk about is the NFL. More specifically, my favorite team. The New York Giants are objectively a terrible franchise. Out of the 32 teams in the NFL, there are only a handful that have had a worse run over the last 8 or so years. Constant mismanagement, incompetent hirings, and bad draft decisions have destroyed any hope that most fans have. In the biggest media market in the world, a market so big that it can sustain two different NFL teams, the constant failures are magnified even more. In three seasons with the Giants, the head coach and general manager that were brought in to fix the state of the franchise have done nothing but produce one lone winning season, and then proceeded to pay a bottom five QB 40 million dollars a year. This hamstrung the team for the next two seasons, and made it so the Giants organization was the laughing stock of the league. This combined with whiffing on key draft picks (including going 0/2 on top ten picks in the same year) has led to some horrible football that will not end without big, and hopefully long lasting organizational changes.
